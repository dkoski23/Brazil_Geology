# Brazil Geology

The data for this project was downloaded from USGS and DIVA-GIS. The South America Geologic Map was taken from USGS, while the Brazilian Administrative Areas as well as Elevation data files were downloaded from DIVA-GIS. The map was created in ArcMap. First, the geologic information was fitted to the administrative area of Brazil so that only the information within the boundaries of the country would be worked with. Next the geologic info was dissolved (conflated) so that the predominant era and rock type for each pixel were shown throughout the country. This information was then fitted to a sliding color scale based upon maximum potential age (done be researching the timeframes of each era/period) and layered with the raster elevation data for Brazil. In order to show the information in the legend the data was exported as a .csv file and concatenated using Python in Jupyter Notebook before bein written out and inserted into the shapefile. A colorated map was then created to show the correlation between rock age and elevation. An image of the elevation raster is data fitted to Brazil and included so the viewer can see the before and after effect of adding the layer of geologic data.
